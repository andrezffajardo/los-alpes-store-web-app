# Los Alpes Store Web App

Welcome to Los Alpes Store, a website developed in React that displays a list of products from a store. This application consumes an external API and allows filtering products by name, deleting products, and editing the information for each of them.

## Installation and usage

To use this application, you must first clone this repository and then install the necessary dependencies:

### `git clone https://github.com/your-username/los-alpes-store.git`
### `cd los-alpes-store`
### `npm install`


Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application with the following command:

### `npm start`

The application will open in your browser at the address http://localhost:3000.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- Axios: for making HTTP requests to the external API.
- Bootstrap: for giving the application an attractive visual style.
- React-bootstrap: for using Bootstrap components in React.

Make sure to have them installed before starting the application.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
